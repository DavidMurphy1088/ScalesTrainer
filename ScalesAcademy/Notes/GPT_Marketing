I have an iOS app that helps elementary and intermediate piano students learn scales for music exams. The exams have strict syllabuses for each usic board and grade. Music boards are Trinity, ABRSM, AMEB etc. We decided piano teachers of individual students would be the decision makers for purchasing the app. What features should the app have to attract piano teachers and make their job easier. Teachers will be most motivated by features that save them time and guarantee their students are ready for their exam
