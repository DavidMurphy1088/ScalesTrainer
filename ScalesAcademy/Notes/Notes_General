This will put whatever is the landing page zip into the MME public domain name.

1 ) Joe will need to use your MME login.
2)  Download/install Google gcloud at https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install. This allows installing the landing page using Google cloud from the Mac command line. (download required only one-item)
3)  Download the zip to the Mac
5)  Go to Mac command line
6) Set project ID with gcloud (required only one-item)
  gcloud config set project musicianshiptrainer-393523
6) cd to the ./Downloads folder. Unpack the zip to the ScalesAcademy sub-folder (note that this name is case sensitive). So the ScalesAcademy subfolder in ./Downloads has all the files.
7) ===> stay in the ./Downloads folder and copy the files to Google cloud with -
gcloud storage cp -r ScalesAcademy/ gs://www.musicmastereducation.co.nz/

Worldwide caching means the content wont be public for about one hour at the MME domain name -
https://www.musicmastereducation.co.nz/ScalesAcademy/index.html

But you should be able to check the new content right after step 7 at this URL

--- Subscriptions ---

Your first subscription must be submitted with a new app version. Create your subscription, then select it from the appâ€™s In-App Purchases and Subscriptions section on the version page before submitting the version to App Review.

Once your binary has been uploaded and your first subscription has been submitted for review, additional subscriptions can be submitted from the Subscriptions section.
- frequencies - 1 week, 1,2,3 or 6 months, yearly

--- Monthly subscriptions ---
For monthly subscriptions, Apple does not send an advance notification or prompt specifically before each renewal charge. Since monthly renewals occur frequently, Apple assumes users are aware of the regular billing cycle, which is disclosed during the initial purchase and confirmed in the original purchase confirmation email.

Key Points on Monthly Subscription Billing and Notifications
No Monthly Pre-Charge Notification: Unlike longer subscription periods (such as annual plans), which might have a reminder a few days before renewal, monthly subscriptions donâ€™t typically receive this notification due to the regularity of charges.

Purchase Confirmation: Users receive an email receipt upon their initial purchase, which clearly states that the subscription will renew monthly until they cancel. This is intended to set the expectation of automatic monthly billing.

Renewal Receipts: After each renewal charge, Apple emails the user a renewal receipt as confirmation. Users can also view their subscription status and next billing date at any time under Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions.

Failed Payment Notifications: If a payment fails, Apple notifies the user via email and provides instructions to update their payment method, offering a grace period to avoid subscription cancellation.

If you want to keep users informed about upcoming charges in your app, you might consider adding in-app reminders around the renewal date as a courtesy, though Apple doesnâ€™t require this.

=== MIDI setup === 1Nov2024
Run Audio Midi Setup on MAC and ensure iPad window is online

Use VMPK virtual keyboard on MAC
 - use VMPK, Edit ->Midi Connections and set Output MIDI Connection to iPad
 
Run MIDI Monitor on MAC to ensure VMPK is sending MIDI events

Run code on iPad to listen for events.

 
Refactoring <---------
Clefs (not staffs) should determine note placment
Staffs have a hand but not a treble, bass type


soundevent handler must filter out any pitch that is not on either keyb or the combined kebb
- if two notes will arrive together at lead the scale: higher will go to RH keyboard, lower to LH keyboard
- if one note arrives it will go to the KB that had the note last closest to new note

- chromatric and contrary n=motion differnet
